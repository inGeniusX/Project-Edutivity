                        No doubt about it, the 2020 presidential election will impact future generations for years to come in terms of the education 
                        sphere and the course of actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. People underestimate the power of educated voters,
                         not in a sense of whether they have had academic schooling or not, but being informed on each candidate’s stances on certain
                          topics and policies, which is extremely important. And that’s what I’m here to do, I want to provide an overview of the 
                          views our two major party candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, take on education in general and in response to COVID-19.
                           Make sure to exercise your right to vote if you are of eligible age and circumstances, the future of education for younger
                            generations will depend on it.

                        Education Response to COVID-19
                     </h1>
                     <p>
                        This pandemic has completely disheveled and overturned the schooling atmosphere as we know it. I still remember sitting in 
                        class that fateful day in March, when my principal came on the intercom and informed us that school had been canceled until
                         Spring Break. To be honest, I was overjoyed at the prospect of an extended break, as most students would be; little did we
                          all know that this “extended break” became more of a permanent effect and now we’ve been sitting behind screens and online
                           learning for the past 8 months. This led me to the question, “How do both possible future Presidents plan on taking action
                            for school reopenings, online vs. on-site learning, the safety and health of teachers and students alike, and other issues?”
                             As a citizen myself, I find it difficult to really understand political information and I’ve always chosen to be pretty
                              removed from the political world; however, it is an issue that I can no longer avoid and have spent the past couple of
                               months trying to keep up with our upcoming election and the state of our country. I try to remain as unbiased as possible,
                                trying to decide for myself how I feel and what I support based on facts, which is difficult in today’s day and age of
                                 social media and news channels that tend to lean towards a party. Here, I will try to provide the major key points of
                                  each candidate’s stance on responding to COVID-19 in the educational department.

                     <p>
                     Voting as an educated citizen is crucial to participating in our republican government. Understanding both perspectives of candidates 
                     and what they have to offer in an unbiased manner is important before making a choice; each presidential candidate wishes 
                     nothing but the best for our country contrary to what the media feeds the public. Carefully examine the actions President 
                     Trump and Candidate Biden say they will take, the past numbers they have put up while serving in office, and vote for the 
                     candidate you deem necessary as the solution to the problems arisen by COVID-19 as well as education. The plans that each
                      candidate proclaims to implement into our system of education can affect every student and teacher in our country. Again, 
                      I would like to emphasize to make sure to exercise the right to vote if you are of eligible age and circumstances, the 
                      future of education for younger generations, as well as current students and teachers, will depend on it.
