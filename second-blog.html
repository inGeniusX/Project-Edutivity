                        Rewind the clock back to 2010 – exactly one decade ago. Prior to COVID-19, online learning was controlled by tech conglomorates like Udemy, edX, and Coursera. These 
                        were paid courses, given by third-party instructors who allowed students to learn at their own pace and time. 
                        The idea behind this was great – if students take control over their own learning, they'll be able to learn 
                        the material at a mastery level. Right? 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        As time passed, the idea of online learning excited everyone. Influential figures such as Bill & Melinda Gates 
                        endorsed the folks at Khan Academy, and it seemed like eLearning was starting to expand exponentially. While eLearning 
                        was an attractive method of learning for individuals who could afford such classes, the idea that eLearning could be done 
                        be integrated into public institutions seemed unfounded. There was absolutely no way that eLearning could replace 
                        the centuries-old traditional face-to-face classroom methods. Even if we were to have some sort of massive cultural/social 
                        shift towards technology, it would be <strong>impossible</strong> to encapsulate <strong>all</strong> students wtihin 
                        the private & public educational systems into a digtal platform. There are too many anomalies: not everyone has internet, 
                        not everyone has a computer, not everyone would be motivated, and students would fool around.  
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Now if we turn the clock forward to 2014, online education was a very real possibility. Despite being introduced in 
                        1989 by University of Phoenix, online degrees emerged as popular alternatives to physical education settings. 
                        But still, these were college students who had the luxary of having the money to afford such programs. A young 
                        boy living in the basement of a stranger's house with his single mother could never have afforded a $1,000 online 
                        program. The idea of online learning on a massive digital scale to capture <strong>EVERY</strong> student was 
                        still a possibility that drifted into nothingness in 2014. Even in 2018, Forbes released an article stating 
                        that eLearning would never replace classroom learning anytime soon. In essence, the editor states that 
                        eLearning's benefits come only when it is used to cater content towards students, and it cannot replace the 
                        meaninful social interactions within the classroom.    
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Now if we refocus ourselves into the present, we've undergone a paradigm shift in education due to COVID-19. 
                        Social distancing measures have forced us to replace our previous traditional classroom methods with digital 
                        platforms to meet with our classes. Despite many predictions stating that eLearning wouldn't happen in a along time, 
                        it happened. The tables have now turned. Some prominent figures are saying that eLearning should replace classrooms. 
                        How should we react?

                     <p>
                        New York teachers were surprised to hear Governor Andrew Cuomo's response on remote learning. On Tuesday, 
                        Cuomo made a statement in a press briefing on whether or not remote learning could replace traditional 
                        classroom methods, stating:

                           <p>"The old model of everybody goes and sits in a classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom and teaches 
                           that class and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms.
                            Why? With all the technology you have?" </p>

                     <p>
                        Not gonna lie, I was pretty surprised to hear this too – how have we made that shift in mentality so quickly 
                        from physical education settings to entirely virtual? The answer confounds reason. Nevertheless, Cuomo made a 
                        further statement regarding the partnership he plans to take on with the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to 
                        "reimagine" education in New York. If you ask me, it's pretty exciting stuff and something I'm really excited 
                        see in the future given Project Edutivity's position within this realm.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Will we really see a change in education in New York though? I mean, who knows; personally, I think COVID-19 
                        is the biggest experiment in history that has high stakes.

                        Khan Academy and has reached over 20 million students with his work in digital education. Khan states that despite 
                        the challenges and obstacles distance learning may thrust towards us, there are some pretty neat things. More and more 
                        individuals are recognizing that there are digital tools that are at students' disposal, and teachers are starting to 
                        figure out how to leverage the balance between online tools and their own instruction. This is what he describes as 
                        "the silver lining" of the entire crisis. Still, despite the major influx of online users, Khan states:

                        This is no surprise, as Khan has stated previously that the teacher is the root of an enriching education as opposed 
                        to the technology. Still, he explains that there is great promise with online education during this crisis.

                        A controversial figure within the educational sphere, Betsy DeVos has been a long time supporter of digital education. 
                        She's made statements in the past praising sophisticated technology that can "personalize" curriculums and cater 
                        material towards individuals. In fact, DeVos's husband made a big donation to K12, a network of online schools. 
                        To me, what's even more interesting is how President Trump and DeVos seem to be at a strife in terms of education. 
                        I was reading an article from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/04/29/somewhat-surprising-thing-president-trump-said-about-online-education/">
                        Washington Post</a> the other day and President Trump said something interesing. He said:

                           <p>Now, we found out that young people do extraordinarily well. That’s why I think we can start thinking about [opening] schools, 
                              but of course we’re ending the school season, so you wouldn’t be back for too long. I noticed where Purdue University, a 
                              great school in a great state, wants to open and have students come in. I think that’s correct. Some colleges, I think, I saw 
                              Harvard wants to have students come back in the fall. I would hope that they’d have students.</p>

                              I think that the whole concept of computer learning is wonderful, but, it’s not, tele-learning, but it’s not the same thing as a 
                              being in a classroom in a great college or a college of any kind. College, university, there’s nothing. You can’t replace that. 
                              Hopefully they’re going to be coming back. Young people do very well with this horrible scourge. They do very well.

                        It's clear here that President Trump thinks that virtual learning should NOT serve as a replacement to traditional classroom learning. 
                        In many respects, I agree, but to a larger extent I disagree. I think there is a large learning curve we [students] need to 
                        get over. Once we get used to things going, we'll be able to act swiftly.

                        It turns out, I don't think online learning will replace traditional classroom learning – the idea is still too 
                        unreachable and unreal. However, eLearning will make a breakthrough within COVID-19's time frame. We've already kinda seen 
                        a breakthrough with companies like Zoom or Blackboard Collaborate. While these aren't perfectly refined technologies, all 
                        breakthroughs don't happen in an instant. A year from now, we'll see the impact that COVID-19 has made on online learning, 
                        but for now, everything will seem to blend with time.

                                 Andrew Tran is a co-founder of inGenius X, web developer, and social entrepreneur. 
                                 As the Director of Project Edutivity, Andrew addresses the educational disparities he once faced within
                                 his community and beyond through mobile app development. The project aims to cover all facets of
                                 education - from the humanities to STEM - so that students from all backgrounds can recieve the 
                                 holistic educational opportunities they deserve. By scaling digital technology, more will be reached, 
                                 more will be educated, and more will be achieved.
